# Introduction & Setup
by [CrimsonMods](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/skytech6/) aka [SkyTech6](https://github.com/CrimsonMods)

Hey! This is a short introduction to modding V Rising. We will be exploring a dice rolling sample mod project, examining the components of how it works, and then we will be expanding the functionality of the mod!

If you want to see what a potential end result of the tutorial would look like check out [CrimsonDice](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/skytech6/CrimsonDice/) that I created alongside this tutorial.
