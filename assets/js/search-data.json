I personally use both Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code while working on V Rising mods. Visual Studio is a full IDE and includes the tools needed to compile DLLs. To my knowledge, Visual Studio Code cannot compile DLLs as it is a glorified text editor; but Code is a much more ingrained piece of software in my workflow due to being a Unity developer. I know some other modders like to use Rider because it includes dnSpy. My recommendation is to start with Visual Studio 2022 and venture out to other options once you’re comfortable. ",

[BepInPlugin(MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_GUID, MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_NAME, MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_VERSION)] [BepInDependency(\"gg.deca.VampireCommandFramework\")] public class Plugin : BasePlugin . I won’t be going into detail on what a Class, Struct, interface, or other types in C# are. You can pick up on that over time as you mod or can checkout some C# tutorials to learn more. The top two elements here BepInPlugin and BepInDependency are Attributes that define how the BepInEx loader should define and handle our mod. Plugin GUID is the assembly name of our mod, you could change this if you wanted to be different than the assembly; but currently it is DiceRoller. As such Plugin Name will also be DiceRoller. There isn’t much reason to have these difference unless you’re building a framework and want to have library-like addresses for your guid (i.e. VampireCommandFramework). Plugin Version defines the current Semantic Version of your mod. 1.0.0 for example is the default. As you update your mod this version will increase and inform user (and Thunderstore) to update. The second Attribute shown is BepInDependency. This tells BepInEx that your mod must be loaded after VampireCommandFramework in-order to function. You can also tell BepInEx that you want to load after specific mods but don’t necessarily need them to be present with DependencyFlag.SoftDependency. But that’s a tad more advanced of a topic. Harmony _harmony; public static Plugin Instance { get; private set; } public static Harmony Harmony =&gt; Instance._harmony; public static ManualLogSource LogInstance =&gt; Instance.Log; public static Settings Settings { get; private set; } . Harmony is a patching library for .NET at runtime. This is what enables us to modify and augment the game’s code to do different things. BepInEx is using a forked flavor of Harmony called HarmonyX. Plugin Instance is simply giving us a Static reference to our Plugin class that we can call anywhere in the application. You can see that both Harmony and LogInstance are being set to instances inside the Plugin static “Instance”. ManualLogSource is the name of BepInEx’s logging system. This will output information to the LogOutpout.log file at runtime. For example: . [Info :CrimsonBanned] |CrimsonBanned[1.2.0] initialized| [Info :CrimsonClans] InitializeAfterLoaded completed [Info :CrimsonStyle] Loaded Styles Database: 3 entries . This is useful for all kinds of reason such as debugging, ensuring the mod is loading, and just general audit information. And lastly there is Settings, we will return to this in a future part soon, but for now just know that it is the container &amp; generator for the BepInEx Config for the mod. ",

Load is that instruction, it is all the elements required to get your mod initially loaded. Now there are instances where you don’t want to initialize everything about your mod at this point; as the server does not exist yet fully. We’ll get into that more with Core.cs. public override void Load() { Instance = this; Settings = new Settings(); Settings.InitConfig(); Log.LogInfo($\"Plugin {MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_GUID} version {MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_VERSION} is loaded!\"); // Harmony patching _harmony = new Harmony(MyPluginInfo.PLUGIN_GUID); _harmony.PatchAll(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()); // Register all commands in the assembly with VCF CommandRegistry.RegisterAll(); } . Learn about void here. Learn about override here. Code is executed top to bottom, so here we can see the first thing we do is set our Instance variable from above to this instance of Plugin. Then we create a new instance of our Settings script and call the InitConfig method from it. Again we’ll go into detail about what this is doing later. We then call our ManualLogSource and output to the log that our mod was loaded. Then we are setting up Harmony for our mod by passing in an identifier (our GUID) and telling it to patch all of the assemblies in our project (everything in the Patches folder in this instance). You can also specify specific things to Patch and Unpatch as well, but again that’s a tad more advanced of a topic that we won’t be going into deeply in this tutorial.

    "content": "This is a large reason for this Template. Every V Rising mod will contain a file called ECSExtensions or Extensions. These are extension methods that apply almost exclusively to the Entity type from Unity. The reason for this script is that reading, creating, and modifying Entity types is not as straight-forward as if V Rising was created with GameObjects (the traditional method of making games in Unity). Instead the game is made with the Entity Component System (or ECS). Notice I don’t include links here. Don’t worry about what ECS is for now. Just know that every object in V Rising derives from Entity and these allow you to access them. This version of the file in the template contains XML Summaries. These are blocks of documentation that generate tooltips when you use them in Visual Studio. We’ll go over a few of the most commonly used one though. public unsafe static void Write&lt;T&gt;(this Entity entity, T componentData) where T : struct . Write is used for modifying the data on an Entity. Say you want to change the Health of an Entity? You would get reference to the Health data, change the values, and then entity.Write(healthData) to update it with your changes. public unsafe static T Read&lt;T&gt;(this Entity entity) where T : struct . Read is what allows you to read the data from an Entity. From the above example if you wanted to know the Health values you would need to use entity.Read&lt;Health&gt;() first. public static bool Has&lt;T&gt;(this Entity entity) . You may wonder what would happen if you try to Read data that doesn’t exist on the Entity? Well it will cause an exception. First you need to check that it exists with Has like entity.Has&lt;Health&gt;(). public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(this Entity entity); public static void Remove&lt;T&gt;(this Entity entity); .

A TOML-like file generated in BepInEx/config for users to customize the experience of your mod. Having a detailed and descriptive config file can help your mod go from It does X to being able to do a varied number of configurations on different servers. Imagine you wanted to make a mod that changed the base stats of players. You would want to put each stat into their own Config entry; that way each server could configure how they want the stats to be instead of forcing your “hardcoded” values on every server that uses the mod. Let’s start simple though. public static ConfigEntry&lt;bool&gt; ToggleMod { get; private set; } . This defines a ConfigEntry with the type of bool (true or false) called ToggleMod. Then in our InitConfig method we define it using the InitConfigEntry method. public static void InitConfig() { ToggleMod = InitConfigEntry(OrderedSections[0], \"Toggle\", true, \"If true the mod will be usable; otherwise it will be disabled.\"); ReorderConfigSections(); } . InitConfigEntry has four parameters. Section - The section it would appear under in the config.cfg. In this instance we pull from a List of titles, we’ll come back to that. Key - The name of this config that will be shown in the config for users. DefaultValue - The default value of the setting. In this instance we set it to true. Description - Explains to the user what this setting does. Based on the description and key of this setting; we can see that Toggle will turn the mod on and off with true and false. We can then check this setting anywhere in the mod with the following code . // You'll often see this in short-hand // if (Settings.ToggleMod.Value) checks for True // if (!Settings.ToggleMod.Value) checks for False if (Settings.ToggleMod.Value == true) { DoThing(); // Mod is active lets do stuff } else { return; // Mod is disabled, simply return and do nothing } .

A bit of an anti-pattern, but also the most common way in Unity to manage and track subsystems. The alternative and proper way of doing this in C# would be with Dependency Injection, but in the words of every game dev I’ve ever met: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Sometimes a God object is just what you need to get things done. public static World Server { get; } = GetServerWorld() ?? throw new Exception(\"There is no Server world (yet)...\"); public static EntityManager EntityManager =&gt; Server.EntityManager; . Here are two of the most commonly referenced things in all of V Rising. World is how you can access majority of systems in the game. It is the “root”. We call it Server typically because we’re doing mainly making server mods. Would probably call it Client if doing a client mod, but would need to do the GetClientWorld route instead? I don’t make client mods. EntityManager this is how you can access any Entity anywhere. You’ll see it referenced a lot in that Extensions.cs file, but for the most part the beginning of this tutorial doesn’t interact with Entities much. We will use this more in later tutorials. public static DiceService DiceService { get; internal set;} . This isn’t a built-in type of V Rising (ProjectM or Stunlock Assemblies), but a custom service that is defined in the Services folder by us. We need to define it somewhere and since this is our God object, we create all our services in this script. public static void Initialize() { if (hasInitialized) return; DiceService = new DiceService(); hasInitialized = true; } . We can see that this script has a single public method called Initialize. This is the magic. When it gets called it creates our needed services which can then be used anywhere in our mod. It also sets a static bool to ensure that it can’t be re-initialized because of the early return. Now you might be wondering how do we call this method? Where is the correct place to do so if services depend on information from the Server that needs to load? . That leads us smoothly to… Next What is Patching? . ",

This is done by using a tool called Harmony to modify the IL (Intermediate Language) of the game. This was mentioned in the Introduction but is worth going into more detail because it is the core of modding the game’s Systems. We left off the last chapter wondering where in the game we could call our Initialize method. Well we know a System in the game that will be called every time the game has finished loading. We are going to Patch that system. Open Patches/InitializationPatch.cs. [HarmonyPatch(typeof(SpawnTeamSystem_OnPersistenceLoad), nameof(SpawnTeamSystem_OnPersistenceLoad.OnUpdate))] public static class InitializationPatch { [HarmonyPostfix] public static void OneShot_AfterLoad_InitializationPatch() { Core.Initialize(); Plugin.Harmony.Unpatch(typeof(SpawnTeamSystem_OnPersistenceLoad).GetMethod(\"OnUpdate\"), typeof(InitializationPatch).GetMethod(\"OneShot_AfterLoad_InitializationPatch\")); } } . The first line there is the Attribute that tells Harmony what to patch. The first parameter is the type of the method we want to patch. The second parameter is the name of the method we want to patch. In this case we want to patch the OnUpdate method of the SpawnTeamSystem_OnPersistenceLoad class. Note: Your class must be static for Harmony to patch it. Above the method we have a HarmonyPostfix attribute. This is a special attribute that tells Harmony to run our method after the original method has finished. This is important because we want to make sure that our Initialize method has been called after the System has loaded. Then we call our Core.Initialize method knowing that the game has finished loading. And because this is a one-shot patch, we need to unpatch it after we have called it. This is done by using the Unpatch method of the Harmony instance. The first parameter is the type of the method we want to unpatch. The second parameter is the name of the method we want to unpatch. In this case we want to unpatch the OnUpdate method of the SpawnTeamSystem_OnPersistenceLoad class. ",

    "content": "Services are a way to make your mod more modular and reusable. They are a way to separate functionality into different classes that can be used anywhere in your mod. I like to categorize them into two categories: V Rising and Mod functionality. V Rising Services are those that are created to make interacting with a specific feature of the game easier or more efficient. For example, it is very common to see mods have a PlayerService that handles all the logic for player entities. This is a good example of a V Rising Service. You can see one here. Then as included in the sample project, we have a DiceService that is a custom service that is used to roll dice in the Services folder. Let’s take a look at the DiceService now. internal class DiceService { public static List&lt;int&gt; ValidDice; public DiceService() { ValidDice = new List&lt;int&gt; { 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100 }; } . We can see that it’s an internal class that has a static list of valid dice. It also has a constructor that sets the list of valid dice. The constructor is called when the service is created. This is important to know because it means that the service can be created in the Core.cs file and then used anywhere in the mod. It then contains a series of methods that are related to rolling dice; keeping the Service limited to just that functionality which can be used anywhere. public static bool IsValidDie(int die) { return ValidDice.Contains(die); } public static int RollDie(int die) { return new Random().Next(1, die + 1); } public static int RollDice(int die, int count) { int total = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) { total += RollDie(die); } return total; } .

It is not required to make mods, but quite often you will want to have a command to do something. Let us take a look in the Commands folder and select DiceCommand.cs. [CommandGroup(\"dice\")] internal static class DiceCommands . You can see here above our Command class we use the CommandGroup attribute. This means that all commands in this class will be prefixed with dice. [Command(name: \"roll\", shortHand: \"r\", description: \"Roll dice\", adminOnly: false)] public static void Roll(ChatCommandContext ctx, string dies = \"1d20\") { if (!DiceService.ValidateHandOfDice(dies, out int die, out int amount)) { ctx.Reply(\"Invalid dice format. Use the format 'AMOUNTdDIE' (e.g. 1d20)\"); return; } int result = DiceService.RollDice(die, amount); ServerChatUtils.SendSystemMessageToAllClients(Core.EntityManager, $\"{ctx.User.CharacterName} Rolled {amount}d{die} = {result}\"); } . And here is our command roll defined with the Command attribute. This defines the name of the command, the shorthand, the description, and if it is admin only. In our method we define a ChatCommandContext which is a wrapper around the ChatCommand class. This is a class that contains all the information about the command that was sent. We can then use this to reply to the user. And we require an input parameter from the command called dies. This is the dice that the user wants to roll. You can see that the dies parameter has a default value of 1d20. This means that if the user does not specify a dice, it will default to 1d20. We check if the dice is valid using the ValidateHandOfDice method from the DiceService. If it is not valid, we reply to the user and return. If it is valid, we roll the dice and send the result to all clients. So the command when typed into the chat would look like this: .dice roll 1d20 . And that covers all the systems and scripts included in the sample project. Next let’s see how to build this into a usable DLL. Next How to Build . ",
